This repo is a Python prototype/testbed for the String word game described below.


String is a word game for iOS devices in which letter blocks fly up (think scrabble tiles) as the user attempts to run his finger through the blocks to string together a word before the blocks fall back down off the screen. Words are scored based on length and difficulty of letters. Each letter has a score, similar to how scrabble letters are scored. There may be more than one possible word to be formed with each set of letter blocks that are presented. The user can play in several different game modes. In time attack mode, the user attempts to get the highest score in a certain amount of time or score up to a set number of points in the shortest amount of time. In casual mode, the user has no game overs and can continue playing no matter how many times he fails to form a word. In marathon mode the user plays until he fails to form 3 words and receives a game over. Player's scores are tracked through global online leaderboards. String will initially be available for iOS devices with future support planned for Android and potentially PC with Kinect and or Leap motion control.
